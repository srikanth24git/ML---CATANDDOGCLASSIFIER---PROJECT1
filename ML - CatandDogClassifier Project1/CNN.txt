CNN
A CNN is a deep learning model that learns patterns from images such as edges, shapes and objects, just
like the human brain.

CNN automatically learns features, unlike traditional ML where we manually extract features.

Convolution layer:
	Imagine scanning an image using a small window (filter) to detect patterns.

ReLU Activation:
	ReLU keeps positive values and removes negative values.

Pooling:
	Pooling reduces image size while keeping important information.

Flatten layer:
	Converts 2D feature maps into 1D vector.

Fully connected(dense) layer:
	Works like traditional neural network, uses extracted features.

Output layer:
	Displays the final output.
